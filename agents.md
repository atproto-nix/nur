# Agents

This project is developed and maintained with the assistance of AI agents. These agents are designed to help with various software engineering tasks, including:

*   **Code Generation**: Writing new code based on specifications.
*   **Refactoring**: Improving existing code structure and readability.
*   **Bug Fixing**: Identifying and resolving software defects.
*   **Documentation**: Creating and updating project documentation.
*   **NixOS Module Development**: Creating and maintaining NixOS modules for services and packages.

Our goal is to leverage AI to enhance productivity and ensure high-quality code while adhering to established project conventions and best practices.

## Recent Activities

In a recent session, the agent successfully:

*   **Defined a NixOS module for the `spacedust` service**: This involved creating `modules/microcosm/spacedust.nix` based on the existing `constellation` module, configuring its options (e.g., `jetstream`, `jetstreamNoZstd`), and setting up its `systemd` service definition.
*   **Integrated `spacedust` into the `nur` package set**: The `spacedust` Rust application from the `microcosm-rs` repository is now built and exposed as `pkgs.nur.microcosm.spacedust`.
*   **Resolved Nix flake build issues**: Debugged and fixed errors related to argument passing (`rustPlatform`, `fetchFromPath`) and package exposure within the `flake.nix`, `default.nix`, and `overlay.nix` files to ensure the `spacedust` package could be built and referenced correctly.
*   **Verified binary functionality**: Confirmed the successful build and basic functionality of the `spacedust` binary by executing it with the `--help` flag.

## Repository Information

This repository (`nur`) serves as a Nix User Repository, providing custom Nix packages and NixOS modules. It integrates various projects, including those from the `microcosm-rs` monorepo, to offer declarative system configurations and reproducible builds.
